#  Interface Segregation Principle

## Separate/Segregate system's abstraction group by functionalities
## Don't create big interfaces or empy functions
## Think in compositions!

## Use case

#### I want to have different types of UILabel (Masked, Image text)
#### One protocol for each case, and not a unique protocol for all !
